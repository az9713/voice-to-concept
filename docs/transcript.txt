So let's check out our agents
0:02
customization screen. So here we have
0:05
arbitrage logic high frequency CPU risk
0:09
dampener prediction engine quantum
0:11
trading market analysis and we get this
0:14
drone model and this hash rate greed and
0:17
speed. Okay, that was pretty cool. Today
0:20
I think we have a pretty cool
0:21
application we're going to build. So I'm
0:23
just going to walk you through what
0:24
we're going to do today. So the basic
0:26
idea is that I wanted an application
0:28
where I can just speak out and it will
0:32
record my voice. So I uh kind of uh
0:36
based this on that I want to speak in
0:38
some kind of ID I have. It could be
0:40
anything but I want to focus on some
0:41
IDs. And when the user speaks in this
0:45
we're going to record this and we're
0:46
going to transcribe it with uh to text
0:49
using whisper. And from there when we
0:51
have the text we can use Gemini 3 and we
0:54
can use Nano Banana uh Pro to generate
0:57
five visuals and an overview and a
1:00
rating on the ID. So you end up with
1:02
kind of like a one pager that you can
1:04
see some visuals around your ID. You can
1:07
see some text maybe you get a rating or
1:10
something like that. I think it turned
1:11
out pretty cool and I want to show you
1:13
kind of how I did this and how this uh
1:16
application works now. So, as always,
1:18
let me show you kind of what
1:19
documentation I needed to actually build
1:21
this in cloud code. And basically, I
1:23
just needed again the Gemini 3
1:25
documentation and I brought in some
1:27
documentation around Nano Banana Pro
1:30
that we have used before in this uh
1:32
shipment series. So, if we head over to
1:34
Claude now, I can just go in here and
1:39
basically again I just basically said
1:42
what kind of application I want. I went
1:44
to plan mode. Uh I don't have any
1:46
recording of me actually building the
1:48
app uh because I did that yesterday. But
1:51
uh I think we want to do some small
1:53
changes today and you can kind of see
1:55
how I use cloud code and Opus 4.5 to do
1:58
that. But now I think we're just going
2:00
to run some demos of the application we
2:02
built and see if there are anything we
2:04
want to change some small tweaks and
2:06
stuff. So let's just do an uh I think
2:09
we're going to do an MPM uh was it
2:12
rundev or was it start? I can't
2:14
remember. Let's try start and let's just
2:16
head over to localhost 3000 refresh. And
2:19
here you can kind of see the app. So you
2:21
can see it kind of saved some of the IDs
2:23
I did in my testing yesterday. So I
2:26
think I want to try to replicate those.
2:28
And you can see we have share your ID.
2:31
We can do text. We can do record. So
2:34
basically when we record this uh this
2:36
will be saved and transcribed with
2:38
whisper. And you can kind of see this.
2:40
So let me just try to record an ID. I'm
2:43
just going to come up with something
2:44
here live now. So, I'm just going to
2:47
press start record.
2:49
Okay. So, I have an idea where uh I want
2:52
some kind of device that I can put next
2:56
to my let's say my flowers or something.
2:58
Put it in like a pot where I have the
3:00
flowers. This has some kind of metal rod
3:03
that is measuring maybe some uh um
3:07
humidity or the temperature and it also
3:10
take images of the plant. So it always
3:13
monitor the plant. It's very easy to
3:15
deploy. It runs on like a USBC charger.
3:18
So it has a long battery with a small
3:20
camera and it could be connected to the
3:22
cloud. So uh on my app I can always
3:25
follow along with all my plants, see how
3:28
they are doing. Maybe it had some AI
3:30
analysis or something like that. So yeah
3:34
uh that is basically me my ID.
3:38
So you can see it now. I just pressed
3:39
stop and you can see transcribing audio
3:42
with whisper and this is going to take
3:44
some time and after we have gotten it in
3:47
text I think it should pop up. Yeah.
3:49
Okay, that was pretty fast. And now you
3:51
can see we are analyzing your ID with
3:52
Gemini and then we're going to do the
3:55
illustrations or visualizations. And
3:58
yeah, let's just see how this turns out.
4:00
Okay, so you can see we got this uh
4:02
title here. Flora lens smart stick. see
4:05
what your plants feel. That is basically
4:07
what we turned this into. Okay, so we
4:10
got a rating of 8 to 10. And here comes
4:12
our images. So this is our hero product.
4:16
We can kind of see a camera sticking
4:18
into the soil here. And we got a closeup
4:21
of the hero product. Okay, that looks
4:23
pretty cool.
4:25
And yeah, let's see what else we got
4:27
here. You can see we have the analysis,
4:30
an intelligent camera equipped IoT
4:32
monitoring stick.
4:34
Uh, and yeah, we get some feedback. We
4:37
get some suggested improvements. Add a
4:39
module solar planner clip on accessory
4:43
to extend battery life near windows.
4:45
Okay, that's pretty smart. Include a man
4:48
manual privacy shutter for the camera
4:50
since this will be placed inside homes.
4:52
Also a good idea. Design the head of the
4:55
device to be adjustable, tiltable. Okay,
4:58
not bad. So, yeah. And we got a a mobile
5:04
um UI mockup. Okay, that's pretty cool.
5:08
Uh Insitu lifestyle photography. Okay,
5:11
so here we can see our flora lens. It's
5:14
inside the plant. Pretty cool. And then
5:18
we get a technical
5:20
um exploited. Okay, so here like a
5:23
blueprint. So, we have the visual
5:26
sensor, the neural processor, lithium
5:28
battery, hydrometer rod, and the USBC.
5:33
Pretty cool. Uh, let's see now. Here's
5:35
the macro detailed shot of the Flora
5:38
lens. Okay, so you kind of get the point
5:40
here. So, I went from just reading in my
5:43
ID to ending up with something like
5:46
this. And maybe I had some kind of
5:48
export or something. Export to PDF. I
5:50
haven't fixed that. Uh, but I think
5:52
that's a pretty cool thing you can do.
5:54
Uh, I want to try it on one different
5:56
idea. So, let's try to visualize like a
5:58
video game. Okay. So, let's try a new
6:00
ID. So, we're just going to click on new
6:01
ID. We're going to keep those. And I'm
6:03
going to record this. So, I'm just going
6:05
to think of an idea. I think I have
6:07
something. So, let me just record this.
6:10
Okay. So, I have a pretty cool idea for
6:13
a video game. So the game is going to be
6:16
more of like um a realtime
6:20
uh game where you uh control and
6:23
generate AI agents. So you can train
6:26
these agents. So basically they can be
6:30
trained or leveled up in like
6:32
cryptocurrency.
6:34
Some agents you can train up, level up,
6:36
pick skills and stuff maybe for poly
6:39
market prediction markets. Some could do
6:42
stock options. So basically you in the
6:45
game you control like a fleet of AI
6:48
agents that you send out to maybe earn
6:51
money. So it's more like a a real life
6:54
game play. Uh you pay a fee of course to
6:57
get access to the platform that can
6:59
execute and the platform we run of
7:01
course will take a cut of the earnings
7:04
from the AI agents. uh the players will
7:08
need to stake their AI agents
7:09
themselves, but we kind of provide the
7:11
platform, the interface and stuff like
7:14
that. So, uh I kind of want the
7:17
interface and the look of the game to be
7:19
more like this um more this like
7:21
isometric uh hacker look with like a
7:26
terminal pixelated styling. Okay, so
7:28
let's just try that idea. I'm not 100%
7:30
sure if that's going to work, but let's
7:32
see what Gemini comes up with here. And
7:34
I also think the idea is going to get a
7:36
really low rating because that is like a
7:39
ludicrous idea, right? But let's just
7:41
see what happens. Oh wow, we did get
7:43
actually an eight out of 10. Net yield
7:45
zero. Okay, that was a bit pretty cool
7:47
name. Deploy the code. Harvest their
7:50
reality. Okay, so let's see what the
7:51
visuals is going to look like. Okay, not
7:54
too bad. I kind of like this. So this is
7:56
the command deck UI. So we kind of have
7:59
like some uh bots here. We have some
8:01
code. We have some Bitcoin. Okay, maybe
8:04
not the most um
8:07
uh useful thing, but let's see what else
8:09
turns up here. Let's read some of the
8:11
points. Realtime strategy mechanics
8:14
applied to financial markets. RPG style
8:16
progression for AI agents. Uh real money
8:20
economic only staking and yield sharing.
8:23
Okay. Integration with data sources like
8:25
poly market and stock exchanges. The
8:28
feedback is this is a cultural relevant
8:31
high potential concept that merges
8:33
addictive loops of RPG management games
8:36
with the thrill of crypto speculation.
8:39
Okay, I think this is a cool idea. So
8:41
improvements are implement a sandbox
8:44
mode using paper money. So then test.
8:46
Okay, that's a good idea. Create guilds
8:48
and syndicates where players pull
8:50
computational power. Okay, that's pretty
8:52
cool. Uh, add a visual boss battles
8:55
representing high volatility market
8:57
events, earning calls, election results.
9:00
All right, not too bad. So, let's check
9:02
out our agents customization screen. So,
9:06
here we have arbitrage logic, high
9:08
frequency CPU, risk dampener, prediction
9:12
engine, quantum trading, market
9:14
analysis, and we get this drone model
9:17
and this hash rate, greed, and speed.
9:20
Okay, that was pretty cool. I'm going to
9:22
download this one. This was awesome. And
9:24
here we kind of see the network. So this
9:26
is the an isometric world map
9:29
representing different financial
9:30
markets. We have the poly market,
9:32
crypto, commodities, derivatives, forex,
9:35
forex, and we going to have some Yeah,
9:37
maybe the players can move around. We
9:39
have uh what is this? A visual
9:42
representation of agent executing a
9:44
trade.
9:46
Okay. And here kind of is the logo for
9:49
the game. net yield. All right, pretty
9:52
cool. Yeah, I think this turned out very
9:54
well. And we can kind of see from this
9:56
application how fast we can kind of go
9:59
from an ID, we get like a suggestion of
10:02
a uh a name. We also get some visuals,
10:06
you get an an AI analysis of the ID and
10:09
you get some suggested improvements. I
10:12
think this is just super cool. I I
10:14
really like this app. This is one of the
10:16
favorites we have made so far in the
10:17
shipment series. We can go back and
10:19
check this, right? So, we can see the
10:21
one we made before. And yeah, this is
10:24
working pretty good. But to be honest, I
10:26
don't think I need to change anything. I
10:28
was kind of ready to go into cloud code
10:30
and make some changes to this app. Uh,
10:32
but I just think it works. I don't think
10:34
I need to do anything. Maybe we could
10:36
have had something that could you could
10:38
follow up and make some changes.
10:41
Uh, but other than that, I think it
10:42
looks pretty cool. I really enjoy this
10:44
one, the drone unit, right? and the BIOS
10:47
setup utility. Uh but yeah, that was uh
10:51
this day's uh AI app suggestion or like
10:56
uh yeah, and thank you for tuning in so
10:59
far. Uh it's been really fun to doing
11:01
this daily and I'm going to keep trying
11:02
to do this more. So yeah, have a great
11:06
day and I'll see you again hopefully
11:07
tomorrow, if not day of day
